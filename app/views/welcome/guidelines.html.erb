						By creators, for creators

					<p>
						Imagine a platform where you can create, collaborate, build communities, and get paid to do it. A place where everyone can finally just be themselves.
					</p>

					<p>
						Well, that‚Äôs what Takko is all about.
					</p>

					<p>
						But we need your participation.
					</p>

					<p>
						So don‚Äôt mind us while we run through some of the things we‚Äôre counting on you to work with us on. The more we can all pitch in, the better the Takko community will become.

						Be original
					</h2>

					<p>
						First thing‚Äôs first, let's takko ‚Äòbout YOU. As an individual,  you bring a little something-something to the world that no one else does. We‚Äôre talking about creativity, but everyone‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù is completely different or subjective.
					</p>

					<p>
						We want you to celebrate it. Post to your heart‚Äôs content. But, there‚Äôs a small caveat that we need to talk about. On the legal side of things, we all have to follow copyright and trademark laws.
					</p>

					<p>
						Translation? You must post original content ‚Äî no stealing or posting someone else‚Äôs content without permission. When you repost content without permission, you‚Äôre essentially using someone else‚Äôs hard work to your advantage. Not cool, you know?

						Be kind
					</h2>

					<p>
						Everyone should have fun and feel welcomed while hanging out on Takko, and we truly believe that you get what you give.
					</p>

					<p>
						In that spirit, we want you to use the right to free speech, as long as it‚Äôs not inciting hatred or violence towards any individual or groups of people.
					</p>

					<p>
						Takko welcomes everyone, so someone‚Äôs religion, worldview, or morals might be different ‚Äî and that‚Äôs 100% OK with us. All we ask is that if you want to post about things that could potentially be deemed  as ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù which can include sex, sex-worker rights, sex-positivity, or artistic expression, you ask yourself, ‚ÄúWill this teach someone something valuable, create healthy dialogue, or will this get flagged as inappropriate?‚Äù
					</p>

					<p>
						And if you‚Äôre not sure, just ask us at <a href="mailto: support@takkoapp.com">support@takkoapp.com</a>. We‚Äôre always available to talk it out or guide you down a path you‚Äôre comfortable with.

						Be considerate
					</h2>

					<p>
						Remember how we said we‚Äôre all about free speech and freedom of expression? Well, as mentioned, controversial topics come with the territory.
					</p>

					<p>
						So, in the spirit of being considerate towards others, we‚Äôre asking everyone to label posts to the best of their ability. If you think there‚Äôs even a slight chance that your content might actually affect someone, please add the right labels and cautionary warnings, if necessary. 
					</p>

					<p>
						On our end, we‚Äôll keep you in the loop on any policy changes and provide as much transparency when possible.

						Be authentic
					</h2>

					<p>
						Share anything that makes you happy, anything that entertains or informs others, or anything you think someone would get a laugh out of. Be authentic ‚Äî however you define that. We‚Äôre all in for that. 
					</p>

					<p>
						However, what we don‚Äôt stand for are boosted likes and follower counts or comment spamming. You know, those silly shenanigans aren‚Äôt great for the health of the community and aren't a good look on your own personal branding either.

					<p>
						We‚Äôre counting on you to help us out here. If you can do that, then Takko can be a relaxed, positive environment for everyone. And who doesn‚Äôt want that?
					</p>

					<p>
						This is why we‚Äôve built in a reporting system. It‚Äôs less of a ‚Äútattle-tale‚Äù and more of a way to let us know if the community is going off the rails. If you see something that makes you feel attacked or blatantly violates our guidelines, let us know. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Our global team is always looking through the platform and removing harmful content that has been reported on their end, but your added help goes a long way.

						And finally, the best part: we want you to feel welcomed in a thriving community of creators who work together and hold each other accountable.
					</p>

					<p>
						That‚Äôs what Takko‚Äôs all about. In order for our platform to remain welcoming, positive, and fun, it‚Äôs going to take a little effort from everyone ‚Äî both from you and our team. Let‚Äôs work together on this. Deal? Great. Now get to creating! :)
