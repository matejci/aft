							To the extent you Post User Content on the Service and elect to receive payments from Takko based on the payment terms available on your settings page, as we may update them from time to time in our sole discretion, you hereby appoint Takko as your payment collection agent solely for the limited purpose of accepting funds on your behalf in connection with the User Content you provide on the Service. Payment from an advertiser on the Service to Takko shall be considered the same as payment made directly to you by the applicable advertiser. Upon an advertiser‚Äôs payment of funds to Takko, such advertiser‚Äôs payment obligation to you for the agreed upon amount is terminated, and Takko is instead responsible for remitting the funds to you in the manner described in this Agreement. Your recourse is only against Takko if Takko fails to remit funds received from an advertiser pursuant to the terms hereof. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, Takko shall remit payments due to you hereunder via Stripe Connect no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month in which the applicable fees are received by Takko. By using our Service, you agree to be bound by Stripe‚Äôs Services Agreement available at <a href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal</a>. All information that you provide in connection with a monetary transaction interaction with us and Stripe Connect must be accurate, complete, and current. Payment shall be in the form you select when you register for the Service, or as subsequently updated as permitted by the Service. Takko reserves the right to withhold payment or charge back to your User Account any amounts otherwise due to us under this Agreement, or amounts due to any breach of this Agreement by you, pending Takko‚Äôs reasonable investigation of such breach. Takko also reserves the right to withhold payment or charge back to your User Account any amounts subject to dispute, such as in the case of credit card charge backs, pending successful resolution of the dispute. To ensure proper payment, you are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with your User Account, which includes without limitation applicable tax information. If we believe that we are obligated to obtain tax information and you do not provide this information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold your payments until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us that you are not a person or entity from whom we are required to obtain tax information. Any third-party fees related to returned or cancelled payments due to a contact or payment information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment. You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your participation in the Service. If you dispute any payment made hereunder, you must notify Takko in writing within thirty (30) days of such payment or from when you purport such payment would have been due, whichever is earlier. Failure to so notify Takko shall result in the waiver by you of any claim relating to such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by Takko. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by Takko or have any effect under this Agreement and you shall have no audit rights hereunder. We may withhold any taxes or other amounts from payments due to you as required by law.

							12.2 Arbitration
						</h3>

						<p>
							<span class="uppercase">Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Takko.</span> For any dispute with Takko, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto: support@takkoapp.com">support@takkoapp.com</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Takko has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, ‚Äú<b>Claims</b>‚Äù), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County, California, unless you and Takko agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney‚Äôs fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Takko from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.
